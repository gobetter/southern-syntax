# @southern-syntax/ui

## Purpose
Reusable UI component library built on Radix/UI and Tailwind-compatible styling.

## Responsibilities
- Provide design-system primitives (Button, Dialog, Table, etc.)
- Export utility helpers like `cn`

## Usage notes
- Import components from `@southern-syntax/ui` inside React apps
- Components are tree-shakeable ESM modules with TypeScript types
- Keep styling consistent with global design tokens
