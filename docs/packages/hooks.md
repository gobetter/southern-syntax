# @southern-syntax/hooks

## Purpose
Collection of React hooks that are framework-agnostic (work in React/Next). Examples: form utilities, state helpers.

## Responsibilities
- Provide reusable logic extracted from apps
- Remain dependency-light (no Next-specific APIs)

## Usage notes
- Import desired hook from `@southern-syntax/hooks`
- If a hook depends on Next.js features, place it in `@southern-syntax/hooks-next` instead
